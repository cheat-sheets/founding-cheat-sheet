## Pre-founding Dilemmas

Top motivations for starting a company:

1. Making a difference in the world.
2. Financial gain.
3. Power and influence.
4. Autonomy.
5. Recognition.

Best time to start a company:

1. Favorable **Career** Circumstances:
   - Broad and deep work experience (managerial experience, functional background, industry knowledge, 
   working in small vs big companies, nontraditional experiences, social capital)
   - Low opportunity costs
   - Change in golden handcuffs (the social status of an impressive title or well-known employer, and golden handcuffs, 
   such as a high salary or a vesting schedule that requires one to keep working in order to earn stock awards) 
2. Favorable **Personal** Circumstances:
   - Entrepreneurial motivations
   - Supportive family situation
   - Cash cushion
   - Positive role models (most powerful influences may come from the early messages sent by the words and actions 
   of older relatives or by the culture in which a person grew up)  
3. Favorable **Market** Circumstances:
   - Big opportunity  
   - Favorable context - are many companies competing for scarce resources?
   - Customer willingness to pay - how big is the market? Is it growing?
   - Ticking clock - is the window of opportunity about to close? Ticking-clock industries include 
      - those in which products and services are quickly derived from and just as quickly outdated by technological or
      scientific advances, 
      - those with strong "network effects" - that is, the value of the product increases as more people use it
      - those with significant economies of scale.

## Founding Team Dilemmas

### The Solo-versus-Team Dilemma

Only look for cofounders when you are missing important human, social or financial capital at time of founding:

- **Human capital**: Human capital includes the explicit knowledge derived from formal education
	and the tacit skills derived from prior experience. 
- **Social capital**: Social capital refers to the benefits derived from one's place in information
	and communication networks. New startups need to reach out to recruit employees, establish
	relationships with potential partners, meet potential investors, and gain access to many other
	outside resources. The startup will benefit from cofounders' contacts and social capital.
- **Financial capital**: Financial capital refers to the money or other tangible resources that can be
	used in the founding process.  
	
Other options may include:
- Outsourcing
- Finding advisors
- Partnering with complementary companies

### Relationship Dilemmas

Founding team **Homogeneity** vs **Diversity**

- Tangible Factors:
   - **Human capital**: cofounders with similar human capital can communicate more easily but the team may be missing critical skills.
   - **Social capital**: mutual obligations are more enforceable but the divercity of information received by the team is reduced.
- Intangible factors:
   - **Decision-making style (hierarchical vs consensus)**: cofounders with similar styles make decisions more quickly. 
   But there is no counterbalance.
   - **Risk tolerance (risk-seeking vs risk-averse)**: cofounders with similar risk tolerances may be more stable partners.
   But there is no counterbalance.
   - **Commitment level**: cofounders with similar levels will be more likely to appreciate each other's efforts.
   But there is no counterbalance.
   - **Value system**: cofounders with similar values will be more aligned regarding their priorities and preferences.
   But there is no counterbalance. 

Strangers (no prior relationship) -\> Past co-workers (prior professional relationship) -\> Friends and Family (prior social relationship)

- the likelihood of discussing "Elephants in the room" is the lesser the closer prior relationships between cofounders.
People tend to worry that raising thorny issues between friends / family would signal distrust of that friend / relative.
If a business decision makes business sense but might damage the
social relationship, founders naturally try to avoid making the business decision in the hope that the
problem will pass.
- the risk of destroying prior relationship is the greater the closer prior relationships between cofounders.  

Founders who decide to mix business and social relationships despite these dangers should at least
take proactive steps to protect themselves and the startup:
- **Compartmentalize relationships**: If the team's size allows, avoid having cofounders report to
their relative or close friend. Instead, have the cofounder report to another senior executive,
keeping the private and professional relationships separate.
- **Envision negative scenarios**: Think about the obstacles — such as family issues, medical
crises, and legal problems — that could affect a cofounder's ability to work on the startup.
Resist the natural inclination of many founders to "stay positive", focusing on only desirable
scenarios.
- **Create a disaster plan**: Put in writing a plan of action for the worst-case scenarios, such as
an irresolvable business conflict or a breakup in the social relationship. Also, make it clear
who has the final say in an impasse. Sign an exit contract that will apply if a worst-case
scenario develops.
- **Force sensitive discussions**: Make a long-term policy of being open and honest about every
personal issue that arises in the process of working together. Increasing the likelihood of
discussing sensitive issues — by establishing a mechanism for it — can reduce the Playing-with-Fire Gap. 
Resist the natural inclination to put off or avoid
discussions of difficult issues in the hope that they will solve themselves.
- **Involve a referee**: In order to prevent a professional disagreement from getting personal,
write up a memo on the issue at hand and copy the entire executive team. 
This forces others to get involved
and puts the emphasis on the issue itself rather than on the people advancing the issue. Or, use
a mutual mentor or impartial advisor to mediate.
