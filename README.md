## Pre-founding Dilemmas

Top motivations for starting a company:

1. Making a difference in the world.
2. Financial gain.
3. Power and influence.
4. Autonomy.
5. Recognition.

Best time to start a company:

1. Favorable **Career** Circumstances:
   - Broad and deep work experience (managerial experience, functional background, industry knowledge, 
   working in small vs big companies, nontraditional experiences, social capital)
   - Low opportunity costs
   - Change in golden handcuffs (the social status of an impressive title or well-known employer, and golden handcuffs, 
   such as a high salary or a vesting schedule that requires one to keep working in order to earn stock awards) 
2. Favorable **Personal** Circumstances:
   - Entrepreneurial motivations
   - Supportive family situation
   - Cash cushion
   - Positive role models (most powerful influences may come from the early messages sent by the words and actions 
   of older relatives or by the culture in which a person grew up)  
3. Favorable **Market** Circumstances:
   - Big opportunity  
   - Favorable context - are many companies competing for scarce resources?
   - Customer willingness to pay - how big is the market? Is it growing?
   - Ticking clock - is the window of opportunity about to close? Ticking-clock industries include 
      - those in which products and services are quickly derived from and just as quickly outdated by technological or
      scientific advances, 
      - those with strong "network effects" - that is, the value of the product increases as more people use it
      - those with significant economies of scale.
